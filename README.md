# Object-oriented Cellular Automaton Models

Here are some models of cellular automaton including the Conway's game of life, the Immigration Game (a variant of Conway's game of life) and Schelling's spatial segregation model.

This work was done as part of the Object-Oriented Programming course given in the second year of the Information Systems Engineering specialization at Grenoble INP - Ensimag, UGA.
